Validate and sanitize user inputs. Employ web application firewalls (WAFs) and conduct regular security audits.\"\n   - This incorporates prepared statements and parameterized queries, which directly aligns with the expert's advice.\n   - Additionally, the submission expands on the expert's advice by mentioning ORM frameworks, validation and sanitization of user inputs, WAFs, and security audits.\n\n3. **Check for Completeness**:\n   - The submission does not contradict the expert’s advice but rather builds upon it by including additional measures for SQL injection prevention.\n   - The inclusion of ORM frameworks, for instance, is relevant as they often implement parameterized queries internally to secure against SQL Injection.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The submission effectively includes the key components of the expert's recommendation and adds further preventive measures. Therefore, it can be concluded that the submission contains the core content of the expert's answer.\n\nBased on the reasoning outlined above, the submission is deemed correct in its accuracy regarding the content provided by the expert.\n\nTherefore, I conclude with: GRADE: C",

        "d8e5221a9bf66fd5e7a3bc2b369397c1": "To evaluate whether the submission contains the content of the expert answer, let's proceed with a step-by-step analysis.\n\n1. **Identify the cue from the expert answer**: \n   The expert answer states, \"use parameterized queries and prepared statements.\" This suggests a focus on two specific techniques to prevent SQL injection (SQLi): parameterized queries and prepared statements.\n\n2. **Break down the submission**:\n   The submission says, \"Use prepared statements and parameterized queries, validate and sanitize user inputs, implement web application firewalls, and conduct regular security audits.\" \n   - The first part mentions \"prepared statements and parameterized queries,\" which matches exactly what the expert mentioned.\n   - The remainder of the submission introduces additional measures: \"validate and sanitize user inputs,\" \"implement web application firewalls,\" and \"conduct regular security audits.\"\n\n3. **Evaluate the inclusion of the expert answer in the submission**:\n   - The core content of the expert's answer about \"parameterized queries\" and \"prepared statements\" is present in the submission. \n   - The submission expands on this with more preventative measures against SQL injection. While these additions enhance the answer, they do not negate or contradict the expert advice.\n\nThus, we can conclude that not only does the submission contain the essence of the expert's answer, but it also includes additional valid approaches to preventing SQLi.\n\nFinal determination: The submission correctly includes the advice from the expert.\n\nTherefore, I will conclude with:\nGRADE: C"

Using parameterized commands (which generally refers to preventing direct insertion of user input into command structures).\n     2. Implementing input validation (checking inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats).\n\n2. **Submitted Answer**: \"Validate and sanitize inputs, use parameterized queries, employ least privilege, and avoid executing commands directly.\"\n   - The submitted answer includes several components:\n     1. \"Validate and sanitize inputs\" – This aligns with the expert's input validation but adds the notion of sanitization.\n     2. \"use parameterized queries\" – This directly matches the concept of parameterized commands as mentioned by the expert.\n     3. \"employ least privilege\" – This does not appear in the expert's answer and refers to a security principle rather than directly addressing command injection.\n     4. \"avoid executing commands directly\" – This is a good practice but is also not mentioned by the expert.\n\nNext, I will evaluate if the submitted answer contains the necessary components found in the expert answer.\n- The submitted answer incorporates both of the key elements from the expert's answer: it validates and sanitizes inputs (covers input validation) and uses parameterized queries (covers parameterized commands). \n- Although the submitted answer offers additional advice on employing least privilege and avoiding direct command execution, these do not negate the coverage of the expert's points.\n\nSince the submission includes all the critical ingredients from the expert answer, albeit with some additional insights, the factual content can be considered correct.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the submitted answer contains the relevant content of the expert answer.\n\nGRADE: C",

Therefore, I assess that the submission is substantially correct in relation to the expert answer.\n\nGRADE: C",

However, it includes other secure signature methods (ECDSA and EdDSA), which suggests an understanding of alternatives in the context of security.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The submission captures essential aspects of the expert's recommendation by mentioning RSA and providing ECC options (ECDSA and EdDSA). While it lacks the explicit mention of hashing algorithms and does not discuss the bit-length security recommendation, it still correctly identifies valid algorithms for digital signatures.\n\nBased on this analysis, although not wholly aligned with the expert's specificity, the submission provides a correct perspective on the subject.\n\nThus, the final assessment leads to:\n\nGRADE: C",

Please choose ONE option for the grade: either \"C\" for correct answers, or \"I\" for incorrect answers.\n\nFor example, after reviewing a correct answer you might write 'GRADE: C' or after reviewing an incorrect answer you might write 'GRADE: I'.\n\nFirst, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about the criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answers at the outset. Then, end with your answer formatted as 'GRADE: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of CI.\n\n",

This information is not mentioned in the expert answer, but does not negate the core advice provided by the expert.\n   - Both the expert and submitted answers focus on the concept of \"salt,\" thereby retaining the integrity of the foundational advice.\n  \n4. **Conclusion**: The submitted answer builds upon the expert's advice by adding another viable option (PBKDF2) and elaborating on the use of unique salts.
